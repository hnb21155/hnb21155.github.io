		<div><p>My cats name is Finn. He was born May 15th 2017. I adopted him on Black Friday of last year. He is a tabby cat that loves to chase toys. Finn lives with me in Athens, but sometimes he stays at my parents house in Cumming Georgia. When he visits my parents house, Finn plays with my family cat, Snowball. Snowball is seven years old and very easygoing. Finn and Snowball like to play fight and cuddle together. </p>

	<h3><strong STYLE= "text-decoration: underline">Stormy and Luna</strong></h3>
		<p>My best friends all live in a house on 277 Arch Street. They have two indoor cats that live with them. One cats name is Stormy, and she is about the same age as Finn. Stormy likes to bite people and play with her pet fish. Luna is the second indoor cat that lives at 277 Arch Street. She is a Russian Blue (<span STYLE="font-style: italic">Felis catus</span>) and has very pretty golden eyes. Luna likes to fight with Stormy. Sometimes Luna likes to run outside or sit on top of the tall bookshelf.</p>
